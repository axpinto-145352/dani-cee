## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

The Brokerage Inc. has grown from a family-owned insurance agency founded in 1976 to a national FMO/IMO/BGA with $45M in annual revenue and approximately 164 employees across multiple locations. This growth has brought complexity — 90+ software tools across departments, manual workarounds between systems, and process inefficiencies that cost time and money.

### What We're Proposing

A comprehensive **Process Optimization & Automation Audit** to:

- Map current workflows across all departments
- Identify automation opportunities and process bottlenecks
- Assess your technology stack for redundancy and gaps
- Develop a prioritized roadmap for improvements
- Provide education and training recommendations
- Deliver implementation guidance for quick wins

### The Investment

| Component | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| Audit engagement | $14,000 |
| Ongoing support (90 days) | Included |
| **Total** | **$14,000** |

This fits within your stated budget of under $20K while providing a solid foundation for bringing an in-house developer on board.

## 5. Methodology

### Our Approach

We follow a structured methodology that balances thoroughness with efficiency:

```
Week 1–2: Discovery          Week 3: Analysis          Week 4: Delivery
┌──────────────────┐         ┌──────────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│ • Leadership     │         │ • Process maps   │      │ • Final report   │
│   interviews     │    →    │ • Gap analysis   │  →   │ • Roadmap        │
│ • Dept. heads    │         │ • Automation     │      │ • Presentation   │
│ • Staff sample   │         │   scoring        │      │ • Handoff docs   │
│ • On-site visits │         │ • Cost-benefit   │      │ • Training plan  │
│ • Tool audit     │         │   analysis       │      │ • Quick wins     │
└──────────────────┘         └──────────────────┘      └──────────────────┘
```

### Interview Approach

| Interview Type | Duration | Participants | Focus |
|---------------|----------|--------------|-------|

| Staff sample | 30 min | 2–3 per dept. | Day-to-day reality, workarounds |
| On-site observation | 2–4 hrs | Shadowing | Watch processes in action |

### Tool Audit Approach

For each of the 90+ tools, we document:

| Attribute | What We Capture |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Usage** | Who uses it, how often, for what |
| **Cost** | Monthly/annual spend, contract terms |
| **Integration** | API capabilities, current connections |
| **Overlap** | Does another tool do the same thing? |
| **Disposition** | Keep, replace, consolidate, or eliminate |
